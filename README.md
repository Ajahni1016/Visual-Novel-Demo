# Visual-Novel-Demo

A demo for a visual novel game that I began working on this semester. It was made using a combination of Ren'Py, Python 3, and JavaScript.

## Organization
A spreadsheet was used to organize the dialogue, and I edited a simple JavaScript script to export it to a JSON file. The speadsheet/JSON file contains various information including the dialogue, the current background, what sprites should be shown on the screen at any moment, special effects, audio triggers, etc. The code then parses this information and uses it to construct the scene in the game.

Though the demo only shows a snippet, all of the dialogue for the story has been written already.

*Note: The sprite position defaults to left if a position is not specified.*


## Background & Graphics
For the backgrounds, I used Blender to construct a 3D scene and used Photoshop to edit the renders and make then match the style I was looking for.

I have completed 10 out of 21 backgrounds so far. [View them here](https://github.com/Ajahni1016/Visual-Novel-Demo/blob/main/Backgrounds.md)

## Sprites
The character artwork has not been completed yet, so a friend of mine put together some sketches for me to use as temporary sprites.

## Usage
To run the demo just run the ABctheGame.exe file.

Alternatively, here is a quick video of the demo running from start to finish.
